TODOS (all):
- Implement a timeSwitchBeats waltz parameter to allow for mixed-time waltz for certain songs
- Implement a deltaBPM or bpmSwitchPoints parameter to handle songs with variable tempo
- Decide which songs work best at half tempo vs full tempo waltz
- Create a script to repeatedly call Waltifier.waltzifyFile designed to waltzify each version of the whole soundtrack
